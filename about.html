    <h1>About Pixel Planets</h1>
    <p>
        Pixel Planets is a web-based interactive experience that allows users 
        to create and customize their own pixel art planets. Users can choose 
        from a variety of biomes, atmospheres, and features to design unique 
        worlds. The planets are procedurally generated, meaning each planet is 
        one-of-a-kind. Users can save and share their creations with others, 
        as well as explore planets created by the community.
